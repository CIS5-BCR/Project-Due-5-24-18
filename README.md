Lib Mad - Application Details


Primary Purpose:                    The purpose of Lib Mad is to playa word game with the user.     

Scope:                              This program is only a single story that is only interesting for a single run.

Restrictions:                       All of the character arrays used for inputmust be declared at the begining of the 
                                    program and are only capable of storing up to 63 characters + a null terminator. This 
                                    can be changed by simply delcaring the constant to be something else.
                        
Dependencies and assumptions:       User must understand english for this program to be of any use. Program relies on
                                    the MASM32 SDK
            
Technical Functionalities:           Program requests and outputs user data at multiple points. There are two main
                                    subroutines called mainInput and storyTime. All user input is gathered in mainInput.
         
         
Text Adventure - Application Details

Primary Purpose:                    The application is a "game" that sets up a scenario and then accepts user input to 
                                    branch to what is most likely a lose state.

Scope:                              This is a small program where you will have seen everything within 3 tries.

Restrictions:                       The program only responds to 4 user inputs. Attack or attack will lead to one scenario,
                                    Flee or flee will lead to a second scenario and anything else leads to a third scenario.

Dependencies and assumptions:       Requires masm32 libraries and assumes user can read and understand english. 
                                    A keyboard is required for text input.

Technical Functionalities:          Program displays a string of text and then accepts user input to branch to one 
                                    of three scenarios. After the scenario is displayed it waits for a key to be pressed and
                                    exits the program.
