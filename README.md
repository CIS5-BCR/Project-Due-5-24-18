Lib Mad - Application Details

Primary Purpose:                    The purpose of Lib Mad is to playa word game with the user.     

Scope:                              This program is only a single story that is only interesting for a single run.

Restrictions:                       All of the character arrays used for inputmust be declared at the begining of the 
                                    program and are only capable of storing up to 63 characters + a null terminator. This 
                                    can be changed by simply delcaring the constant to be something else.
                        
Dependencies and assumptions:       User must understand english for this program to be of any use. Program relies on
                                    the MASM32 SDK
            
Technical Funtionalities:           Program requests and outputs user data at multiple points. There are two main
                                    subroutines called mainInput and storyTime. All user input is gathered in mainInput.
